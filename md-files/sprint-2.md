# KONSPECTO Sprint 2: Core Framework Initialization Summary

## Sprint Overview

**Duration:** 2 weeks
**MVP Status:** ✅ Completed
**Goal:** Basic frontend and backend frameworks are set up with a functional health check API.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Set Up Frontend Framework ✅

- **Initialized React.js project:** The project was already initialized using Vite.
- **Configured routing with React Router:** Routing was already configured in `App.jsx`.
- **Implemented a basic page for interacting with the agent through a text field:**
  - Created a new component `AgentInteraction` for interacting with the agent.
  - Added a route for the new component in `App.jsx`.

### 2. Set Up Backend Framework ✅

- **Initialized FastAPI project:** The project was already initialized.
- **Implemented a health check endpoint (`/health`):** The endpoint was already implemented in `main.py`.
- **Set up basic API structure with versioning (`/v1`):**
  - Added a new endpoint `/v1/agent` for interacting with the agent.
  - Created a new router for versioned API endpoints.

### 3. Finalize Containerization ✅

- **Completed `Dockerfile` configurations for frontend and backend:** Dockerfiles were already configured.
- **Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include frontend and backend services:** The configuration was already in place.
- **Verified that both services are running correctly in Docker containers:**
  - Ran `docker-compose up --build` to ensure all services are running correctly.

### 4. Enforce Development Standards ✅

- **Linting and Formatting:**
  - Ensured `flake8` is properly configured for Python code in the backend.
  - Ensured `ESLint` is properly configured for JavaScript/TypeScript code in the frontend.
  - Integrated `black` (version 23.1.0) for Python code formatting.
  - Integrated `Prettier` (version 2.8.8) for JavaScript/TypeScript code formatting.

### 5. Initial Testing Setup ✅

- **Set up testing frameworks for frontend (`Jest`, `React Testing Library`) and backend (`pytest` 7.3.1):** Testing frameworks were already configured.
- **Wrote basic tests to verify the health check endpoint and frontend rendering:**
  - Added a test for the health check endpoint in `backend/tests/test_main.py`.
  - Added a test for frontend rendering in `frontend/src/__tests__/App.test.jsx`.

## Achieved Results

1. ✅ Basic frontend and backend frameworks are set up.
2. ✅ Functional health check API is implemented.
3. ✅ Basic page for interacting with the agent through a text field is implemented.
4. ✅ Docker containers for frontend and backend are running correctly.
5. ✅ Development standards for linting and formatting are enforced.
6. ✅ Initial testing setup is completed.

## Known Issues and Next Steps

1. Need to implement core API endpoints for agent interaction.
2. Need to enhance frontend components for better user interaction.
3. Need to set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KONSPECTO.git

# Start development environment
docker-compose up --build

# Access services
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend: http://localhost:8000
API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Sprint Retrospective

### What Went Well

- Successfully set up basic frontend and backend frameworks.
- Implemented a functional health check API.
- Established clear project structure and development standards.

### Areas for Improvement

- Need better documentation for local development.
- Could optimize Docker build times.
- Should add more comprehensive testing setup.

### Next Sprint Focus

- Implement core API endpoints for agent interaction.
- Enhance frontend components for better user interaction.
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## Conclusion

Sprint 2 successfully established the core framework for the KONSPECTO project, setting up the basic frontend and backend structures, implementing a functional health check API, and ensuring that all services are running correctly in Docker containers. The project is now ready for further feature development in subsequent sprints.
